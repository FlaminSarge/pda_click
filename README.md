# pda_click
Resend `pda_click` animation events to the sending client, so they see them in thirdperson

The `pda_click` command, when used while holding a Disguise PDA or Build/Destroy PDA, causes the Spy or Engineer to play a little button-pushing animation that every other player on the server can see. However, the player using it can't see it themselves in a third-person view. This plugin merely adds a fix so that they can see themselves pushing the button.
